# Microsoft Engage 2021 - Be Agile
Project Submission for the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement was to built the fully functional prototype that enable video chat with atleast one minimum mandatory working functionality to enable video chat between two user.Methodology used was the Agile Methodology along with the addition on extra feature.

## How to use the application.
1. Clone the project - 
2. Go to the project directory - cd Microsoft-Engage-Program
3. Open two terminal.In first terminal - npm start
4. In second terminal - npm run watch

## Adopt Feature.
Enabling the chat feature in the application that allow participant to communicate via text chat without disrupting the flow of meeting. That is capable to store the text before the person join.

## Agile Methodology.
The mentorship mainly focused on Agile methodoly, and the first introduction about it was given in the Webinars.Agile practices involve developing solutions through the collaborative effort of cross-functional teams and their customer/end user.Agile Scrum Methodology is the software development method that involves the building of
the software(functionality) in every iteration. Every Iteration has sprints, and in this sprint the building of the feature and improving of the project comes into picture.

1.In the first week the focus was on to research and explore for the libraries and pacakes that can be used for the building of the project. First week also inclue the learning phase for some of the feature that is required for development.

2.In the second week the building phase start simple prototyoe were made using WebRTC, using socket.io simple peer package. In the second week I worked to build my first compentancy matrix, where the listing of the to-do things were added. The list include the workflow the flow along with the time duration to complete it.

3.The third week focused on to built the adapt feature on the top of the existing prototype that give insight of the Agile Methodology.

4.In the fourth week after have a brief about the Design Thinking via the webinar, I work on the developemnt of the change theme feature, inspired with the idea that to differentiate between the sector wise group in the meet, a video theme switcher need to be included so as to differentiate between the various feild of teams present in the meeting.

## Demo
Functional Demo is present in youtube.

## Best coding practice follow
1. The code follow DRY principle.
